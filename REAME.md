# PeVK - Petit Vulkan

A long long time ago, in a far away galaxy, I was an aspiring developer and I implemented [PeGL](https://github.com/maeln/PeGL), a small OpenGL 3D engine.
The goal was to learn real-time computer graphics and maybe one day make my own demo.

Fast forward some years later and I am now a professional developer who still didn't make a demo.
But boy, did I learn a few things since then.

As you can guess now, PeVK is the spiritual sucessor to PeGL.
The goal is to make a small 3D engine using Vulkan and Rust and maybe, one day, make my own demo with it.

For now, it's just me following the Vulkano guide and learning about Vulkan.
